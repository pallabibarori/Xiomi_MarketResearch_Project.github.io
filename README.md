### CHAPTER 2: ANALYSIS OF WORK DONE AND DESIGN
### 2.1 Analysis Overview: The main aim of the project is to analyze data using Market Analysis to understand the pattern in which customers prefer buying items. This can be used to understand the days in which most online sales are made so that appropriate tactics such as sales can be designed to attract maximum customers. Further with the data the online retailers will be able to identify the customer behaviour.

### 2.2 Data Understanding: I have used fictional data.
This data contains 43200 observations and has 7 columns. They are as follows:
1.	Column A - Customer : This column indicates the unique Customer ID. It is numeric in nature.
2.	Column B - Day: These columns contain the days of the weekwise data.
3.	Column C - Browser: This column gives us information on what browser was used by the customer.
4.	Column D - Clicks : This column gives us the date on number of clicks made by the customers.
5.	Column E - PagesViewed: This column gives us the idea of the number of pages viewed by each customer
6.	Column F - Time: This column gives the amount of time spent by each customer during their website visit.
7.	Column G - Amount Spent: This column gives us the amount spent by each customer
All the values under the Customer in the data is unique, and there is no null data present.

2.2.1.	Count of customer visiting from each browser

## CHAPTER 3: LEARNING EXPERIENCES ON BUSINESS/TECHNOLOGY

Working on this project has helped me to understand this data better and the power of visualization. Even though I did not manually create the data, but as an analyst I made sure to go through the entire data before using it to make sure it was clean and ready for my use.

This project has also helped me apply Exploratory Data Analysis on my data set to uncover hidden patterns. 
With the help of Market Analysis, not only have we understood the shopping pattern of online customers but have also deciphered the correlation between different entities, e.g. correlation between No. of clicks and Amount Spent by the customers. This gives us the insight that as the number of clicks rises, chances of money spent is also higher as customer might be checking more products.

Through this project I was also able to gain hands on experience on MS Excel, SQL and Tableau. This project also helped me in understanding Business Documentation and statistical application.

This project helped me to do quality research on the topics present in this paper which further helped me solidify my theoretical knowledge through this practical application. It helped me to understand data trends and create metrics.

By applying all this knowledge in this project I have been able to project rules, which will help us understand how to raise sales and profit. We can use this to design offers, discounts to attract more customers.

## CHAPTER 4: CONCLUSION
In conclusion, this retail analytics project helped us gain some major insights on the buying pattern. By using these customer data, we can predict future sales and hence the retailers can untap hidden data to drive growth in their business and success.

### 4.1 Findings
1. Monday has the maximum amount of sales with an average of Rs. 9083 and maximum amount of time spent with an average of 15.32 minutes per user.
2. Monday also has the maximum page views by each customer and maximum number of clicks made by the customers.

### 4.2 Recommendations
1. Analysis indicates a significant spike in sales on Mondays, suggesting that this day is optimal for launching new offers to maximize impact and revenue.
2. Sales data shows that Fridays are the second-highest day for sales, making it a strategic choice for implementing special sales promotions.
3. Web traffic analysis reveals that Saturdays have the second-highest number of page views, providing an excellent opportunity to advertise upcoming Monday offers on the website to boost engagement and anticipation.
